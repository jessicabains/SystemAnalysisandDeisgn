CS 255 Module Eight Journal

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The clients name is Liam. He is the owner of DriverPass. He wants to design a system where students can take online classes and practice tests that are up-to-date with the DMV guidelines. Students can also schedule for in-person training with an driving instructor who will provide honest feedback. The students are able to check the driver comments on their accounts. Students are able to update their information and reset their password by themselves or they can get help from the IT officer. The owner can generate reports and disable packages when needed.  

•	What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well on the business requirements and constructing the use case diagram, activity, and sequence diagram. I thoroughly read the interview transcript and write down everything DriverPass requires and the components needed for the system. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
One part of my work that I would like to revise is the UML class diagram. I still need to improve on writing all the attributes and methods. I can improve by looking at examples and taking more time to think the connection between the classes and what each class requires. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I was considering the user’s needs since the start. The business requirement model and the UML use case diagram, activity, sequence, and class diagrams helps understand the needs for the DriverPass and the user. It gives a better understand on what the user will need and the steps we need to take to make it successful. For example, my activity sequence diagram provides a sequence of steps on how the user will purchase a package, from adding a package to the cart to verifying the payment method. It is important to consider the users need when designing because the users are the target audience who will be using the design. Considering the users needs help ensure that the design will align with their expectation and requirements. 

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Before designing software, it is important to know what DriverPass requires and expects the system to do. Once we know all the components needed for the system, we can then break it down into smaller steps which makes it easier to work with. Writing in a template and creating diagrams has made me realize how easier it can be to work on a project when it is organized. It helps better understand the project and connect all the information. It also save times and prevent stress.
